This project presents a heartfelt digital memorial page featuring a live, animated flip-clock counter. Dedicated in Hebrew, the page serves as a tribute, marking the time elapsed since a significant spiritual event (June 12, 1994) while also commemorating the Mashpia Rabbi Zusha Posner on the 12th of Shevat 5782 (February 3, 2022). The title "Rest in Peace" (in English) combined with the profound Hebrew question "עד מתי?" (Until when?) and the statement "רצוננו לראות את מלכנו" (We want to see our King) evokes a deep sense of longing and remembrance.
